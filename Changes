Revision history for Perl extension WWW-Scraper-ISBN-GoogleBooks_Driver.

0.09    27/05/2012
	- GoogleBooks redirects to local sites, which do not necessarily have
	  the same data for testing, or the same words for pattern matching.
	  As such, language specific patterns are now included (de & en).
	  If this distro does not work within your country, please let me know
	  the test results, and I'll try and adapt the code. Patches are also 
	  welcome too ;)
